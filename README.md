# Glacial Journeys UI/UX Project
As a UI/UX Designer for the Glacial Journeys project, I was responsible for the end-to-end design process, from initial research and analysis to the creation of high-fidelity wireframes. This role required a deep understanding of user needs and behaviors in the context of winter sports travel, as well as the ability to translate insights into intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces.
